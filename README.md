# reverse-character-array-of-words

.e.g.

The intial array:

`{'f','o','x',' ','b','r','o','w','n',' ','q','u','i','c','k',' ','t','h','e'}`

should be reversed to:

`{'t','h','e',' ','q','u','i','c','k',' ','b','r','o','w','n',' ','f','o','x'}`

The arbitray restrictions placed on this task are:

- No new arrays can be created
- A single character variable can be used to temporarily store characters
